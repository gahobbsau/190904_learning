ERROR 2 - EMAIL RESTRICTION

https://github.com/settings/emails
> untick setting for "Block command line pushes that expose my email"


170412 Meaning of the GitHub message: push declined due to email privacy restrictions
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43378060/meaning-of-the-github-message-push-declined-due-to-email-privacy-restrictions

"This is likely caused by a new GitHub setting that blocks command line pushes that expose your email address.
Try unchecking the "Block command line pushes that expose my email" box in your email settings and then pushing again."

https://github.community/t5/How-to-use-Git-and-GitHub/push-declined-due-to-email-privacy-restrictions/td-p/7660

SOLUTION
git config --global user.email "myemailaddress@gmail" [Already set]
git rebase -i
git commit --amend --reset-author
git rebase --continue
git push

I found rebase -i allowed be to edit the commit message but retained the previous (private) email address in the log.

The commit --amend --reset-author seemed to be the easiest way to replace the offending email address.
